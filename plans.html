            <p>
                After I graduate, I aim to get hired at a small to medium game development
                studio, or amongst a software development job. If I can't
                get a game development-related employment, I'll devote
                some time on the side towards the creation of a game
                of my own. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I intend to keep learing about game development and
                further my programming skills even after
                graduation as I know their will still 
                be more to discover.
